\section{Motivation:}
Microarray experiments are frequently designed to characterize classes of
samples and genes.  However, a challenge in the analysis of these data is the
relatively small number of samples observed compared to the number of genes
measured for each sample.  Unless bolstered by additional sample and gene
metadata, results produced under this condition are less strong, and the data
less suitable for re-analysis when considering other biological questions.

\section{Results:}
We present a gene-gene transcriptional correlation matrix of \emph{Homo
sapiens} prepared from a very large, quality-controlled set of Affymetrix
HG-U133\_Plus\_2 microarrays.  We demonstrate that gene function can be
predicted and that linkage regions can be reduced to caual genes with high
precision using this resource, even in the complete absence of sample metadata.

\section{Availability:}

data is also provided here, as well as from the Bioconductor website

\subsection{Data Processing}\label{Processing}

We retrieved RMA-processed gene expression data for the HG-U133\_Plus\_2
arraydesign from the Celsius microarray data warehouse \cite{rma,celsius} and
denote the $S$=\input{m0_row} array $\times$ $P=$\input{m0_col} probeset matrix
as $M$. %(Equation \ref{equation:M}).

%\begin{equation}\label{equation:M}
%M_{s,p} =
%\begin{pmatrix}
%m_{1,1} & \cdots & m_{1,p} \\
%\vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
%m_{s,1} & \cdots & m_{s,p} \\
%\end{pmatrix}
%\end{equation}

A cursory examination of $M$ that there were abberant arrays present and that
these arrays would have a negative impact on any downstream analyses.  At a
coarse level, there appeared to be at least 3 types of aberrant arrays:

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Alph{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item arrays with extremely high gene expression values across many probesets.
\item arrays with extremely low gene expression values across many probesets.
\item arrays with dissimilar expression values for two probesets reputedly
measuring the same gene.
%\item arrays with dissimilar expression values for genes known to be
%co-expressed (Section \ref{corpass}).
\end{enumerate}

We sought to remove these abberant arrays from the dataset.

\subsubsection{Removal of Dim and Bright Arrays}\label{dimbright}

Class A \& B arrays were easiest to identify.  Details of the exclusion
procedure are shown in Algorithm \ref{algorithm:mprime}.  Essentially, we
calculated the mean expression value of all probesets for each array, then
calculated the mean and standard deviation of a \input{trim_fraction}\% trimmed
distribution of those means.  The trimmed means themselves had a mean of
\input{trimmed_means_mean} and a standard deviation of
\input{trimmed_means_sd}.  A histogram of the distribution is given in Figure
\ref{figure:means}.  There were \input{brightdim_count} arrays with mean a
expression value more than \input{brightdim_cutoff} standard deviations away
from the mean of trimmed means.  These were primarily dim arrays
(n=\input{dim_count}) but there were also bright arrays
(n=\input{bright_count}).  These arrays were removed from further
consideration, leaving matrix $M\prime$ with \input{m1_row} arrays and
\input{m0_col} probesets.

\subsubsection{Removal of Inconsistent Arrays}\label{inconsistent}

Class C arrays were slightly more difficult to find.  To identify them, we
exploited the fact that, via NetAffx \cite{netaffx}, Affymetrix publishes a
probeset $\rightarrow$ gene symbol mapping for their array designs.  We assumed
that pairs of probesets designed to target the same gene were more likely to be
linearly related than randomly selected pairs because they were targetting the
same gene, and that these relationships could be used as a starting point to
identify inconsistent arrays.

We took all \input{symbol_count} unique gene symbols from the NetAffx
HG-U133\_Plus\_2 gene annotation, and identified the subset $G$
(n=\input{symbol_gt2_count}) for which there were two or more probesets.  We
constructed $G$ groups, each corresponding to a single gene symbol, i.e.
$g_1={p_{g_1}1,\dots,p_{g_1}n},\dots,g_G={p_{g_G}1,\dots,p_{g_G}n}$.  Then, for
each $g{\in}G$, we performed a linear regression of $log_{10}(signal)$ for all
possible probeset pairs $p_gA,p_gB$ (n=\input{symbolgroup_pair_count}).

Examination of the probeset pairs with the largest value of $r^2$ revealed that
the majority were control probesets that targeted spike-in sequences that are
added as part of the microarray hybridization for quality control.  Thus, we
concluded that using the built-in control probesets was a robust way to
identify aberrant arrays.  We performed \input{control_probesets_count}
multiple regressions, allowing each control probeset to be the response
variable once.  In the context of a single regression if an array's residual
was, relative to all other arrays' residuals, more than 3 standard deviations
away from the line, we incremented a counter for that array.  After performing
all \input{control_probesets_count} regressions, all arrays that were observed
more than 3 standard deviations more than 5\% of the time
(n=\input{outlier_badrow_count}) were removed from further consideration,
leaving a matrix $M\prime\prime$ with \input{m2_row} arrays and \input{m0_col}
probesets.  This procedure is expressed Algorithm \ref{algorithm:mprimeprime}.
Outlier frequencies per array are shown in Figure \ref{figure:rsquare}.

\subsubsection{Correlating Genes}\label{Correlation}

Subsequent to filtering out abberant arrays from out dataset (Section
\ref{Processing}), we used the $M\prime\prime$ matrix to calculate
$C\prime\prime$, a \input{m0_col} $\times$ \input{m0_col} matrix of Pearson
correlation coefficients for every pair of probesets (Equation
\ref{equation:cprimeprime}).  $C\prime\prime$ was used in all results presented
in Section \ref{Discussion}.

\begin{equation}\label{equation:cprimeprime}
C\prime\prime = cor({M^T}\prime\prime)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Annotating Genes}\label{Annotation Methods}

For each probeset $p \in P$ on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign, we retrieved
and sorted in descending order $r = C{\prime\prime}_p$.  We took $r\prime$, the
derivative of $r$, and used the R Bayesian Change Point \emph{bcp} to identify
$\delta$, the index of the largest value of $r\prime$ that preceded a
mostly-linear portion of the curve.
%A single best change point $\delta$ was
%selected as the index of the largest value of $r$ that preceded 10 consecutive
%values $\hat{p} < 0.5$. 
The subset of probesets where $r > \delta$ were defined as $Q$, and used as
input to the \emph{hyperGTest} function of the \emph{GOstats} package of
Bioconductor \cite{bioconductor} to test for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO)
Biological Process (BP) annotations in a gene set.  \emph{hyperGTest} produced
a set of predicted gene annotations $N_p$ for each $p \in P$ based on the
annotation of neighbors $Q$.  We applied Bonferroni correction to the p-values
associated with each prediction by multiplying each p-value by the total number
of predictions made for the corresponding probeset.  We used these corrected
p-values from predicted annotations $N_p$ that were known to be
non-computationally assigned from the \emph{hgu133plus} package of Bioconductor
\cite{bioconductor} to establish a conservative cutoff, below which predicted
annotations should all be high-quality.  This process is presented in Algorithm
\ref{algorithm:annotation}.

\subsection{Analyzing Linkage Regions}\label{Linkage}

For a given phenotype, a group of known genes $G$ known to be associated with
that phenotype were retrieved from previous publications and online databases.
The list of genes was transformed to a list of probesets $P$ present on the
HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign using the gene symbol $\rightarrow$ probeset
mapping available from NetAffx \cite{netaffx}.  Probesets $P$ were then mapped
to 6-megabase genomic regions $A$ by finding the center point of each
probeset's alignment to UCSC's March 2006 (hg18) version of the human genome
and expanding by 3 megabases in each direction.  Each region in $A$ was then
mapped to a list of all HG-U133\_Plus\_2 probesets $Q$ aligned to that region.
Then, for each $p \in P$, a $Q{\times} G(G \ni g)$ slab was retrieved from
$C\prime\prime$ (Section \ref{Correlation}), and row-summarized to produce a
$Q$-length vector $\vec{\bar{r}}$ of mean correlation coefficients to $G \ni
g$.  The algorithm for this procedure is presented in Algorithm
\ref{algorithm:linkage}.

\end{methods}

\section{Discussion}\label{Discussion}

Our aim was to mine the matrix of correlation coefficients for all probesets on
the Affymetrix HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign for new information.

We wanted to let the data speak for themselves, and so included only a minimum
of metadata.  Metadata for samples hybridized to the arrays were excluded
entirely from analyses.  For probesets, we only included gene-symbol
\cite{netaffx}, genomic alignment \cite{karolchik}, and human-reviewed Gene
Ontology (GO) Biological Process (BP) \cite{go, bioconductor} metadata.

\subsection{Data Processing}\label{Processing Results}

All HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arrays (n=\input{m0_row}) were retrieved from Celsius
\cite{celsius}.  We assessed the arrays using some simple quality control (QC)
metrics, and excluded several hundred arrays as described in Section
\ref{Processing} yielding a \input{m2_row} array $\times$ \input{m0_col} column
matrix, denoted $M\prime\prime$.  We calculated the Pearson correlation
coefficient for every pair of probesets in $M\prime\prime$, yielding a
\input{m0_col} $\times$ \input{m0_col} correlation matrix, denoted
$C\prime\prime$.

\subsection{Disease Gene Recovery}\label{Recovery}

Usually the first published evidence of association between a hereditary
disease and one or more genes does not explicitly refer to the associated genes
but rather describe the association to multiple associated genetic loci that
should be examined more closely \cite{joubert,microcephaly}.  These so-called
linkage regions are commonly up to 10 megabases in size, and thus typically
contain 60-100 genes, assuming an average gene size of 50 kilobases.

When the associated genes are eventually identified, it is frequently the case
that they are all involved in the same biological process, and that this
process is disrupted when one of its components is dysfunctional.  Given that
the genes are involved in the same biological process, it is reasonable to
assume that they will be coexpressed in cells where the process occurs and
thus be positively correlated.

Extending the idea that genes involved in the same biological process will
generally be positively correlated, we sought to use $C\prime\prime$ (Section
\ref{Processing Results}) to simulate the identification of a disease gene.

Our method was to assemble a list of genes $G$ known to be associated with a
disease.  Each gene identifier $g \in G$ was mapped to the corresponding list
of probesets on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign.  The list is denoted $P_g$,
and is derived from the mapping function denoted $J(g)$.  For each probeset in
$p_g \in P_g$, the genomic position was retrieved using the UCSC Genome
Browser, human build hg18 (March 2006) \cite{karolchik}.  We then retrieved a
list of probesets which aligned to a 6 megabase genomic region surrounding the
initial probeset.  The list is denoted $Q_{p_g}$, and is derived form the
mapping function denoted as $K(p)$.  Next, the vector of mean correlaton
coefficient $\bar{r}_{p_g}$ of probeset $q_{p_g} \in Q_{p_g}$ to $P \ni J(g)$
was calculated using function $L(q)$ from $C\prime\prime$.  Finally, the best
gene in the region was identified as the one matching
$J^{-1}(K^{-1}(L^{-1}(max(\bar{r}_{p_g}))))$, the maximum value of $\bar{r}$
for named genes in the simulated linkage region.  If the gene identified was
present in $G$ we evaluated the result as positive.  In the event that genes
not in $G$ met the criterion of $max(\bar{r})$, we evaluated the result as
negative.

We first applied this method to the results of a previous study by Funari,
\emph{et al.} that identified several previously unannotated genes that are
expressed in cartilage tissue \cite{funari}.  This study identified 114 genes
represented by 133 probesets from the HG-U133A arraydesign that were highly
expressed only in cartilage (Table 1).  We performed the scan described, and
were able to positively identify the correct gene 66\% (75/114) times.  A
graphical representation of the 6-megabase region surrounding one cartilage
gene, COL9A2, is given in Figure \ref{figure:COL9A2}.

Next, we applied this method to see if we could identify the four genes known to
be associated with microcephaly.  The purpose of this test was to confirm that
the results in our cartilage trial were reproducible on a completely different
set of genes, as well as to see if the method was robust enough to identify the
known gene given a much smaller profile for comparison.  We were able to
correctly identify 75\% (3/4) of the microcephaly genes.

Finally, we applied our scanning method to Joubert syndrome.  Seven linkage
regions for Joubert syndrome have been identified (JBTS1-JBTS7).  Five of
these have had the associated gene in the region identified (JBTS3=AHI1;
JBTS4=NPHP1; JBTS5=CEP290; JBTS6=TMEM67; JBTS7=RPGRIP1L)
\cite{JBTS3,JBTS4,JBTS5,JBTS6,JBTS7} while regions JBTS1 and JBTS2 have so far
only been linked to D9S158 \cite{JBTS1} on chromosome 9 and a 17-megabase
centromeric region of chromosome 11 \cite{JBTS2A,JBTS2B,JBTS2C}, respectively.

The purpose of this third test was another instance of reproducibility of
results, as well as to see if we could make a prediction as to the identity of
the genes in remaining linked regions JBTS1 and JBTS2 for which a gene has not
yet been identified.  We were able to correctly identify 80\% (4/5) of the five
genes known to be associated with Joubert syndrome.  A plot of $r$-values
surrounding NPHP1 is given in Figure \ref{figure:NPHP1}.  We also show data from the
Gene Expression Atlas \cite{GNF} for the same region in Figure \ref{figure:GeneAtlas}
to demonstrate that NPHP1 could not be identified merely by scanning this
region for brain-specific or even brain-expressed genes.

Based solely on the correlation data, we are able to suggest the
uncharacterized gene C9orf116 as the most likely candidate for the 6-megabase
region surrounding D9S158 that is synonymous with JBTS1 (Figure
\ref{figure:JBTS1}).

We also examined JBTS2 to see if we could suggest any genes that might be
associated with Joubert syndrome in this region as well.  JBTS2 is a
centromere-spanning 17-megabase region on chromosome 11 between markers
D11S1915 and D11S4191 (Figure \ref{figure:JBTS2}).  We included an additional
3-megabases upstream and downstream of the outer markers.  The best candidate
for JBTS2 is AGBL2.  However, this is a large region and there are
highly-correlated genes on both sides of the centromere.  For these reasons we
suggest that the 17-megabase centromere-spanning linkage region JBTS2 is
actually two separate linkage regions which we designate as JBTS2p and JBTS2q
located on the p- and q-side of the centromere, respectively.  The best
candidate in JBTS2p is AGBL2.  Additional candidates in JBTS2p are C11orf49 and
probeset 229687\_s\_at.  The best candidate in region JBTS2q is M4A8B.
Additionally candidates in JBTS2q are SCGB1A1 and probeset 229688\_at.

\subsection{Gene Annotation}\label{Annotation Results}

We observed that each probeset $p \in P$ on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign
typically has only a few highly correlated neighbor probesets, while the
majority of probesets are slightly correlated to slightly anti-correlated.  An
example of the rapid drop in correlation coefficients for a single probeset
1316\_at is shown in Figure \ref{figure:cortip}.  We hypothesized that the
nearest neighbors were likely to be involved in the the same biological
process, and that the observed transcriptional co-regulation would allow us to
suggest roles for unannotated genes, and to suggest previously unknown roles
for characterized genes.

To this end, we first evaluated how well the co-regulated neighbors could be
used to reconstruct human-curated annotation that were already assigned to the
gene using the Biological Process (BP) aspect of the Gene Ontology (GO)
\cite{go}.  To do so for a single BP-annotated probeset, we first needed to
discriminate between nearby and distant neighbors and did so using the
\emph{bcp}, the Bayesian Change Point library of the R programming language.
The subset of nearby neighbors for which BP was available was then tested for
category enrichment using a hypergeometric-based test provided by the
Bioconductor \cite{bioconductor} package \emph{GOstats}.  We tested for
enrichment of all GO BP categories associated with any of the nearby neighbors,
and so adjusted all p-values output by the hypergeometric test using Bonferroni
correction in order to compensate for multiple hypothesis testing.

We then used the BP annotations that were \emph{already known} from existing
literature and ``recovered'' solely based on nearby neighbor annotations to
estimate the p-value below which novel predictions should be accurate.

We were able to recover the correct annotation for XXX\% of known annotations.
The relationship between fractional recovery and confidence of the prediction
(p-value) is given in Figure XXX.  The vast majority of recovered annotations
(XXX\%) had an adjusted p-value of less than XXX, and we used this as a cutoff
below which predicted annotations should be accurate.

More than XXX about 10,000 XXX probesets on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign are not
assigned to any existing gene symbol.  This typically means they were designed
to measure a transcript that is computationally predicted only, and not
supported by any \emph{in vivo} observation.  An additional XXX about
5,000-10,000 XXX probesets are assigned to a gene symbol that are supported by
little or no \emph{in vivo} data.  This group contains predicted genes, as well
as transcripts that have been observed in EST libraries.

Typical probesets in both of these groups have no annotation whatsoever.  We
were able to assign XXX annotations to XXX probesets (XXX\%) in these groups.
The data provided here represent an initial, and thus significant, step forward
in the characterization of the roles of these hypothetical and rarely observed
genes.

Our assignment of an additional XXX annotations to genes which are already
characterized is also significant, as it suggests direct linkage between
biological processes previously known to be only indirectly related.
