\section{Motivation:}
The major goal of human genetics is to identify normal variants and mutations
that lead to specific human phenotypes.  Linkage and association are powerful
tools to identify limited regions of the genome for further analysis to
identify DNA variants causative of disease.  However, the identification of
individual genes responsible for the phenotype is often elusive.  One way to
accelerate the identification of gene mutations and variations is to integrate
gene expression patterns, which provide an additional dimension of information.

\section{Results:}
We describe a broad-based tool that uses all publicly available gene expression
data on a single arraydesign to construct gene-gene expression correlations, and
can be used by individual scientists to explore the gene-gene co-expression
relationships present in this massive dataset to infer biological roles for
individual genes.  These matrices include virtually all human genes and
aggregate data from all laboratories depositing data on the web, as available
from Celsius, a community resource of image files and pre-processed Affymetrix
microarray data.

We show the power of this approach to prioritize sequencing of individual genes
within typical linkage intervals, and suggest novel candidate genes within
linkage regions for Joubert syndrome and Type 2 Limb girdle muscular dystrophy.
We demonstrate a technique that can reveal associations between genes and
biological processes, given a seed set of characterized genes, and present a
set of novel genes involved in cartilage development.

\section{Availability:}

available from \url{http://genome.ucla.edu/projects/XXX}.  Additionally,
software for programmatic access to these data is provided at the Bioconductor
website \url{http://bioconductor.org} in the XXX package.

\section{Introduction}

Genetic linkage and association studies lead to the identification of links
between causal genes or genomic regions and their resulting phenotypes.  These
studies contain unique data, such as pedigree structures, that are not
obtainable through other methods of inquiry.  Data collected using DNA
microarrays also give a unique perspective on genes associated with a
particular phenotype, as the regulation of gene expression is independent of
genomic location.

As the genome era draws to a close, the number of uncharacterized diseases that
are influenced by a single or small number of genes has become very small.
This is because the statistical power required to identify causal links between
genes and phenotypes increases with the number of genes involved in the
biological processes that manifest in the phenotype.  Thus, a major theme in
the post-genome era is that advances will come through integrative approaches
that combine biological data from many sources \cite{liver, operon, csbdb,
wormnet}.

Previous efforts have demonstrated the utility of using gene-gene co-expression
patterns to perform gene characterization \cite{kim, sp, webtom, carlson, aspm,
agca}.  Indeed, this type of retrospective analysis of large volumes of data is
characteristic of microarray studies in general.  However, microarray studies
frequently suffer from lack of statistical power because of the relatively
small numbers of samples observed relative to the number of genes measured
\cite{dimensionality}.  We addressed this problem of dimension transposition
simply by increasing the length of our sample dimension.  That is, we
constructed Celsius, a publicly accessible data warehouse of Affymetrix
microarray data \cite{celsius}.  Celsius contains more than 120,000
microarrays, and for the current-generation human arraydesigns more than 12,000
arrays each.  Further, microarrrays added to Celsius are processed in such a
way to allow for progressive growth of the data set without needing to
reprocess data.

Celsius contains very little experimental metadata.  This position is in stark
contrast to the microarray community at large, which favors metadata collection
and modeling in the extreme \cite{mo,mage,miame}.  While we concede that
metadata provides additional statistical power in data analysis, policies that
require metadata to be deposited concommitantly with assay measurements may
actually be harmful.  By increasing barriers to public release of data via
metadata requirements, the amount of publicly available data is diminished.
This reduction in data volume then effectively reduces our ability to draw
biological conclusions from assay data alone.

Here, we demonstrate that fears of having vast volumes of unlabeled microarray
data are unfounded.  Quantitative microarray data are useful in their own
right, and can be used to address biological problems completely unrelated to
the initial study for which they were produced.

%Gene expression data represent an additional dimension of information that can
%be used to boost statistical power, thus leading to identification of more
%disease genes.  As with linkage and association data, the measurements made by
%whole-genome DNA microarrays provide unique information about gene-gene
%relationships, as the regulation of gene expression is independent of genomic
%location.

\subsection{Data Processing}\label{Processing}

We retrieved RMA-processed gene expression data for the HG-U133\_Plus\_2
arraydesign from the Celsius microarray data warehouse \cite{rma,celsius} and
denote the $S$=\input{m0_row}
array $\times$ $P=$\input{m0_col} probeset matrix
as $M$. %(Equation \ref{equation:M}).

%\begin{equation}\label{equation:M}
%M_{s,p} =
%\begin{pmatrix}
%m_{1,1} & \cdots & m_{1,p} \\
%\vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
%m_{s,1} & \cdots & m_{s,p} \\
%\end{pmatrix}
%\end{equation}

A cursory examination of $M$ that there were abberant arrays present and that
these arrays would have a negative impact on any downstream analyses.  At a
coarse level, there appeared to be at least 3 types of aberrant arrays:

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Alph{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item arrays with extremely high gene expression values across many probesets.
\item arrays with extremely low gene expression values across many probesets.
\item arrays with dissimilar expression values for two probesets reputedly
measuring the same gene.
%\item arrays with dissimilar expression values for genes known to be
%co-expressed (Section \ref{corpass}).
\end{enumerate}

We sought to remove these abberant arrays from the dataset.

\subsubsection{Removal of Dim and Bright Arrays}\label{dimbright}

Class A \& B arrays were easiest to identify.  Details of the exclusion
procedure are shown in Algorithm \ref{algorithm:mprime}.  Essentially, we
calculated the mean expression value of all probesets for each array, then
calculated the mean and standard deviation of a \input{trim_fraction}\% trimmed
distribution of those means.  The trimmed means themselves had a mean of
\input{trimmed_means_mean} and a standard deviation of
\input{trimmed_means_sd}.
%  A histogram of the distribution is given in Figure \ref{figure:means}.
There were \input{brightdim_count} arrays with mean a expression value more
than \input{brightdim_cutoff} standard deviations away from the mean of trimmed
means.  These were primarily dim arrays (n=\input{dim_count}) but there were
also bright arrays (n=\input{bright_count}).  These arrays were removed from
further consideration, leaving matrix $M\prime$ with \input{m1_row} arrays and
\input{m0_col} probesets.

\subsubsection{Removal of Inconsistent Arrays}\label{inconsistent}

Class C arrays were slightly more difficult to find.  To identify them, we
exploited the fact that, via NetAffx \cite{netaffx}, Affymetrix publishes a
probeset $\rightarrow$ gene symbol mapping for their array designs.  We assumed
that pairs of probesets designed to target the same gene were more likely to be
linearly related than randomly selected pairs because they were targetting the
same gene, and that these relationships could be used as a starting point to
identify inconsistent arrays.

We took all \input{symbol_count} unique gene symbols from the NetAffx
HG-U133\_Plus\_2 gene annotation, and identified the subset $G$
(n=\input{symbol_gt2_count}) for which there were two or more probesets.  We
constructed $G$ groups, each corresponding to a single gene symbol, i.e.
$g_1={p_{g_1}1,\dots,p_{g_1}n},\dots,g_G={p_{g_G}1,\dots,p_{g_G}n}$.  Then, for
each $g{\in}G$, we performed a linear regression of $log_{10}(signal)$ for all
possible probeset pairs $p_gA,p_gB$ (n=\input{symbolgroup_pair_count}).

Examination of the probeset pairs with the largest value of $r^2$ revealed that
the majority were control probesets that targeted spike-in sequences that are
added as part of the microarray hybridization for quality control.  Thus, we
concluded that using the built-in control probesets was a robust way to
identify aberrant arrays.  We performed \input{control_probesets_count}
multiple regressions, allowing each control probeset to be the response
variable once.  In the context of a single regression if an array's residual
was, relative to all other arrays' residuals, more than 3 standard deviations
away from the line, we incremented a counter for that array.  After performing
all \input{control_probesets_count} regressions, all arrays that were observed
more than 3 standard deviations more than 5\% of the time
(n=\input{outlier_badrow_count}) were removed from further consideration,
leaving a matrix $M\prime\prime$ with \input{m2_row} arrays and \input{m0_col}
probesets.  This procedure is expressed Algorithm \ref{algorithm:mprimeprime}.
Outlier frequencies per array are shown in Figure \ref{figure:rsquare}.

\subsubsection{Correlating Genes}\label{Correlation}

Subsequent to filtering out abberant arrays from out dataset (Section
\ref{Processing}), we used the $M\prime\prime$ matrix to calculate
$C\prime\prime$, a \input{m0_col} $\times$ \input{m0_col} matrix of Pearson
correlation coefficients for every pair of probesets (Equation
\ref{equation:cprimeprime}).  $C\prime\prime$ was used in all results presented
in Section \ref{Discussion}.

\begin{equation}\label{equation:cprimeprime}
C\prime\prime = cor({M^T}\prime\prime)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Annotating Genes}\label{Annotation Methods}

For each probeset $p \in P$ on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign, we retrieved
and sorted in descending order $r = C{\prime\prime}_p$.  We took $r\prime$, the
derivative of $r$, and used the R Bayesian Change Point \emph{bcp} to identify
$\delta$, the index of the largest value of $r\prime$ that preceded a
mostly-linear portion of the curve.
%A single best change point $\delta$ was
%selected as the index of the largest value of $r$ that preceded 10 consecutive
%values $\hat{p} < 0.5$. 
The subset of probesets where $r > \delta$ were defined as $Q$, and used as
input to the \emph{hyperGTest} function of the \emph{GOstats} package of
Bioconductor \cite{bioconductor} to test for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO)
Biological Process (BP) annotations in a gene set.  \emph{hyperGTest} produced
a set of predicted gene annotations $N_p$ for each $p \in P$ based on the
annotation of neighbors $Q$.  We applied Bonferroni correction to the p-values
associated with each prediction by multiplying each p-value by the total number
of predictions made for the corresponding probeset.  We used these corrected
p-values from predicted annotations $N_p$ that were known to be
non-computationally assigned from the \emph{hgu133plus} package of Bioconductor
\cite{bioconductor} to establish a conservative cutoff, below which predicted
annotations should all be high-quality.  This process is presented in Algorithm
\ref{algorithm:annotation}.

\subsection{Analyzing Linkage Regions}\label{Linkage}

For a given phenotype, a group of known genes $G$ known to be associated with
that phenotype were retrieved from previous publications and online databases.
The list of genes was transformed to a list of probesets $P$ present on the
HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign using the gene symbol $\rightarrow$ probeset
mapping available from NetAffx \cite{netaffx}.  Probesets $P$ were then mapped
to 6-megabase genomic regions $A$ by finding the center point of each
probeset's alignment to UCSC's March 2006 (hg18) version of the human genome
and expanding by 3 megabases in each direction.  Each region in $A$ was then
mapped to a list of all HG-U133\_Plus\_2 probesets $Q$ aligned to that region.
Then, for each $p \in P$, a $Q{\times} G(G \ni g)$ slab was retrieved from
$C\prime\prime$ (Section \ref{Correlation}), and row-summarized to produce a
$Q$-length vector $\vec{\bar{r}}$ of mean correlation coefficients to $G \ni
g$.  The algorithm for this procedure is presented in Algorithm
\ref{algorithm:linkage}.

\end{methods}

\section{Discussion}\label{Discussion}

Our aim was to mine the matrix of correlation coefficients for all probesets on
the Affymetrix HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign for new information.  We wanted to
let the data speak for themselves, and so included only a minimum of metadata.
Specifically, in the analyses of linkage regions (Section \ref{Recovery}) we
included probeset $\rightarrow$ gene symbol mappings available from NetAffx
\cite{netaffx} and probeset $\rightarrow$ genome alignments available from the UCSC
Genome Browser \cite{karolchik}.  In the prediction of gene function we
utilized human-reviewed Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process (BP) codes, as
available from Bioconductor \cite{go,bioconductor}.  In all cases, metadata
about the biological samples, sample treatments, and other conditions of the
original experiments were omitted from our analyses.

\subsection{Data Processing}\label{Processing Results}

All HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arrays (n=\input{m0_row}) were retrieved from Celsius
\cite{celsius}.  We assessed the arrays using some simple quality control (QC)
metrics, and excluded several hundred arrays as described in Section
\ref{Processing} yielding a \input{m2_row} array $\times$ \input{m0_col} column
matrix, denoted $M\prime\prime$.  We calculated the Pearson correlation
coefficient for every pair of probesets in $M\prime\prime$, yielding a
\input{m0_col} $\times$ \input{m0_col} correlation matrix, denoted
$C\prime\prime$.

\subsection{Disease Gene Recovery}\label{Recovery}

Usually the first published evidence of association between a hereditary
disease and one or more genes does not explicitly refer to the associated genes
but rather describes the association to one or more associated genetic loci
that should be examined more closely \cite{joubert,microcephaly}.  These
so-called linkage regions are commonly up to 10 megabases in size, and thus
typically contain approximately 200 genes, assuming an average gene size of 50
kilobases.

When the associated genes are eventually identified, it is frequently the case
that they all play critical roles in a shared BP, and that this process is
disrupted when one of its components is dysfunctional.  Given that the genes
are involved in the same BP, it is reasonable to assume that they will be
co-expressed in tissues where the process occurs, yielding a net-positive
correlation in expression.

Extending the idea that genes involved in the same biological process will
generally be positively correlated, we sought to use $C\prime\prime$ (Section
\ref{Processing Results}) to simulate the identification of disease genes.

Our method was to assemble a list of genes $G$ known to be associated with a
disease.  Each gene identifier $g \in G$ was mapped to the corresponding list
of probesets on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign.  The list is denoted $P_g$,
and we denote this mapping function as $J(g)$.  For each probeset $p_g \in
P_g$, the genomic position was retrieved using the UCSC Genome Browser
\cite{karolchik}.  We then retrieved a list of probesets $Q_g$ which aligned to
a 6 megabase genomic region in the genome centered at the the position of
$p_g$, and we denote this mapping function as $K(p)$.  Next, for each probeset
$q_g \in Q_g$ we calculated the mean correlation coefficient $\bar{r}_g$ to $P
\ni J(g)$ using $C\prime\prime$, and we denote this as $L(q,C\prime\prime)$.
Finally, we selected the best gene within this simulated linkage region that
corresponded to $\max{\bar{r}}$ by mapping back to a gene symbol, specifically
$J^{-1}(K^{-1}(L^{-1}(\max{\bar{r}},C\prime\prime)))$.  If the gene selected
was present in $G$ we evaluated the result as positive.

We first applied our method to type 2 limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LMGD2)
phenotype.  There are 11 genes known to be associated with LMGD2.  For each
gene, we considered all probesets targeting a named gene within a 6-megabase
genomic region centered at the gene's locus.  We calculated the mean
correlation coefficient $\bar{r}$ to the 11-gene LMGD2 profile for each
probeset within the region, but excluding any probesets targeting the gene used
to select the region.  In 55\% (6/11) cases $\max{\bar{r}}$ corresponded to the
causal gene for LMGD2.  A depiction of $\bar{r}$-values surrounding one LMGD2
locus is given in Figure \ref{figure:TTN}.

Next, we applied this method to see if we could identify the four genes known
to be associated with microcephaly.  The purpose of this test was to confirm
that the methods used in our LGMD2 trial would effectively identify genes for a
completely different phenotype, as well as to see if the method was robust
enough to identify the known gene given a much smaller profile for comparison.
In 75\% (3/4) of cases the most correlated gene with the other known
microcephaly genes was correctly identified from a 6-megabase linkage region
surrounding that gene.

Finally, we applied our scanning method to Joubert syndrome.  Seven linkage
regions for Joubert syndrome have been identified (JBTS1-JBTS7).  Five of
these have had the associated gene in the region identified (JBTS3=AHI1;
JBTS4=NPHP1; JBTS5=CEP290; JBTS6=TMEM67; JBTS7=RPGRIP1L)
\cite{JBTS3,JBTS4,JBTS5,JBTS6,JBTS7} while regions JBTS1 and JBTS2 have so far
only been linked to D9S158 \cite{JBTS1} on chromosome 9 and a 17-megabase
centromeric region of chromosome 11 \cite{JBTS2A,JBTS2B,JBTS2C}, respectively.

The purpose of this third test was another instance of reproducibility of
results, as well as to see if we could make a prediction as to the identity of
the genes in remaining linked regions JBTS1 and JBTS2 for which a gene has not
yet been identified.  We were able to correctly identify 80\% (4/5) of the five
genes known to be associated with Joubert syndrome.  A plot of $\bar{r}$-values
surrounding NPHP1 is given in Figure \ref{figure:NPHP1}.  We also show data
from the Gene Expression Atlas \cite{GNF} for the same region in Figure
\ref{figure:GeneAtlas}, demonstrating that NPHP1 could not be identified merely
by scanning this region for brain-specific or even brain-expressed genes.

Based solely on the correlation data, we are able to suggest the
uncharacterized gene C9orf116 as the most likely candidate for the 6-megabase
region surrounding D9S158, also known as linkage region JBTS1.  A plot of
$\bar{r}$ values for JBTS1 is shown in Figure \ref{figure:JBTS1}, with the
maximum value centered at C9orf116 at approximately 137.5 megabases on
chromosome 9.

We also examined JBTS2 to see if we could suggest any genes that might be
associated with Joubert syndrome in this region as well.  JBTS2 is a
centromere-spanning 17-megabase region on chromosome 11 between markers
D11S1915 and D11S4191 (Figure \ref{figure:JBTS2}).  We included an additional
3-megabases upstream and downstream of the outer markers.  The best candidate
for JBTS2 is AGBL2.  However, this is a large region and there are
highly-correlated genes on both sides of the centromere.  For these reasons we
suggest that the 17-megabase centromere-spanning linkage region JBTS2 is
actually two separate linkage regions which we designate as JBTS2p and JBTS2q
located on the p- and q-side of the centromere, respectively.  The best
candidate in JBTS2p is AGBL2.  Additional candidates in JBTS2p are C11orf49 and
probeset 229687\_s\_at.  The best candidate in region JBTS2q is M4A8B.
Additionally candidates in JBTS2q are SCGB1A1 and probeset 229688\_at.

%  We started with a set of 56 probesets
%representing 48 genes that were identified in a microarray study that searched

%Genome Browser \cite{karolchik} to align these probesets to the March 2006
%build of the human genome.

\subsection{Gene Functional Assessment}

Next, we considered whether these correlation data are more generally useful.
In the case of identifying disease genes, the search space was constrained to a
linkage region.  However, some analytical methods are position-independent and
seek to characterize all genes.  One such task is the assignment of functional
annotation.

To evaluate the performance of these correlation data for the assignment of
gene annotation into biological processes, we assembled 114 genes represented
by 133 probesets on the HG-U133A arraydesign.  These genes were previously
characterized in study by Funari \emph{et al.} as having expression patterns
restricted to fetal cartilage tissue, and thus likely to be involved in
development and maintenance of cartilage \cite{funari}.   We refer to this
assembly of known, related genes that is used as a template for matching
similar genes as a \emph{profile} of cartilage tissue.  Next, we calculated
$\bar{r}$, the mean correlation coefficient to the profile, as described in
Section \ref{Recovery}, but did so genome-wide rather than restricting to a
single linkage region.  Then, we rank-ordered the set of all probesets and the
set of the initially selected probesets in the profile by $\bar{r}$ to the
profile.  A plot of the profile's probesets and all probesets distance to the
profile is shown in Figure \ref{figure:cartilage_cdf}.  As expected, the genes
used to construct have an overall higher correlation to the profile indicating
their similarity.  However, within the top 5\% of most similar probesets, XXX
(XXX\%) were not used to construct the profile.  We infer that these genes are
also likely to be involved in cartilage development.

We sought to evaluate how well this profile-based search would perform at
identifying genes involved in a different BP.  The purpose was to replicate our
initial finding with the cartilage profile, and also to evaluate the
significance of BP enrichment for high values of $\bar{r}$.  We chose to use
``muscle contraction'', a BP that is better characterized as measured by number
of GO-annotated genes.  The GO BP term ``muscle development'' (GO:0006936) is
attached to 154 genes, while the GO BP term ``cartilage development''
(GO:0051216) is only attached to 11 genes.

% <execute lang="R">
% zz = read.csv('muscle_contraction_p.csv'); write(cor( zz[,3], -log10(zz[,4]) ), 'muscle_rbar_p_cor.tex');
% </execute>

We selected 5 genes that were non-computationally annotated for the Gene
Ontology term for ``muscle contraction'' (GO term ID GO:0006936).  The genes
selected were UTRN, KCNQ1, MYOM1, SGCA, and ASPH.  These are represented by 13
probesets on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign.  We used the same method, as for
the cartilage profile.  Additionally, we used the GO BP annotation to assess
term enrichment.  Hypergeeometric tests were performed to assess the
significance of the term ``muscle contraction'' within 50 bins of 1 percentile
(approximately 547 probesets) whose lower bound was incremented by 0.1
percentile between neighboring bins.  We observed a positive correlation
between the p-value for term enrichment and the value of $\bar{r}$ relative to
the profile ($p$=\input{muscle_rbar_p_cor}), suggesting that genes with high
values of $\bar{r}$ that are not already known to be involved in muscle
contraction are also likely to be involved.  Figure \ref{figure:muscle_cdf}
depicts the relationship of $\bar{r}$ for genes in the profile and the 5\% of
genes most similar to the profile, and the relationship between $\bar{r}$ and
the p-values derived from the hypergeometric tests for ``muscle contraction''
annotation prevalence.

% <execute lang="R">
% cat ./cartilage_candidates.csv | grep -v NA | perl -ne 's/.+,//;print' | sort | uniq | wc -l > novel_cartilage.tex
% </execute>

If the muscle and cartilage profiles are comparable in their specificity for a
particular BP, we can assign the GO BP term ``cartilage development to an
additional XXX genes that were present in the top 0.5\% of all probesets
(muscle $p<1{\times}10^{-8}$) for an additional \input{novel_cartilage} genes.

%\subsection{Gene Annotation}\label{Annotation Results}
%
%We observed that each probeset $p \in P$ on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign
%typically has only a few highly correlated neighbor probesets, while the
%majority of probesets are slightly correlated to slightly anti-correlated.  An
%example of the rapid drop in correlation coefficients for a single probeset
%1316\_at is shown in Figure \ref{figure:cortip}.  We hypothesized that the
%nearest neighbors were likely to be involved in the the same biological
%process, and that the observed transcriptional co-regulation would allow us to
%suggest roles for unannotated genes, and to suggest previously unknown roles
%for characterized genes.
%
%To this end, we first evaluated how well the co-regulated neighbors could be
%used to reconstruct human-curated annotation that were already assigned to the
%gene using the Biological Process (BP) aspect of the Gene Ontology (GO)
%\cite{go}.  To do so for a single BP-annotated probeset, we first needed to
%discriminate between nearby and distant neighbors and did so using the
%\emph{bcp}, the Bayesian Change Point library of the R programming language.
%The subset of nearby neighbors for which BP was available was then tested for
%category enrichment using a hypergeometric-based test provided by the
%Bioconductor \cite{bioconductor} package \emph{GOstats}.  We tested for
%enrichment of all GO BP categories associated with any of the nearby neighbors,
%and so adjusted all p-values output by the hypergeometric test using Bonferroni
%correction in order to compensate for multiple hypothesis testing.
%
%We then used the BP annotations that were \emph{already known} from existing
%literature and ``recovered'' solely based on nearby neighbor annotations to
%estimate the p-value below which novel predictions should be accurate.
%
%We were able to recover the correct annotation for XXX\% of known annotations.
%The relationship between fractional recovery and confidence of the prediction
%(p-value) is given in Figure XXX.  The vast majority of recovered annotations
%(XXX\%) had an adjusted p-value of less than XXX, and we used this as a cutoff
%below which predicted annotations should be accurate.
%
%More than XXX about 10,000 XXX probesets on the HG-U133\_Plus\_2 arraydesign are not
%assigned to any existing gene symbol.  This typically means they were designed
%to measure a transcript that is computationally predicted only, and not
%supported by any \emph{in vivo} observation.  An additional XXX about
%5,000-10,000 XXX probesets are assigned to a gene symbol that are supported by
%little or no \emph{in vivo} data.  This group contains predicted genes, as well
%as transcripts that have been observed in EST libraries.
%
%Typical probesets in both of these groups have no annotation whatsoever.  We
%were able to assign XXX annotations to XXX probesets (XXX\%) in these groups.
%The data provided here represent an initial, and thus significant, step forward
%in the characterization of the roles of these hypothetical and rarely observed
%genes.
%
%Our assignment of an additional XXX annotations to genes which are already
%characterized is also significant, as it suggests direct linkage between
%biological processes previously known to be only indirectly related.

\section{Conclusion}

These correlation data are generally useful, and may be used to address a wide
variety of biological questions.  We have demonstrated that we are able to
correctly identify causal genes within their linkage regions for several
unrelated disease phenotypes.  We also demonstrated the ability use these data
to extrapolate what is known about a disease process to prioritize candidates
within linkage regions for which the causal gene has not yet been identified.

Further, these correlation data are useful for characterizing non-disease
phenotypes and can be used to characterize genes at global-scale as opposed to
within specific genomic regions.  We demonstrated this using a small set of
muscle contraction genes to identify genes that are known to also be involved
in muscle contraction according to the Gene Ontology Consortium.  We reproduced
this result and demonstrated that this type of enrichment analysis is not
process- or annotation-specific by using a set of cartilage development genes
identified from a previous microarray study to find more genes likely to be
involved in cartilage development.

The versatility of this resource initially surprised us.  The methods used to
assemble the correlation matrix is completely metadata independent -- only the
genomic alignment of probe sequences and the quantitative measurements made by
the microarray were used.  The data set is also very heterogenous.  It is
composed from microarray data generated from thousands of individual
experiments by hundreds of individual scientists, with each experiment using
different biological materials and different hybridization conditions and
protocols.  We conclude that the volume of data assembled here is already
sufficient to trump any particular factor in the production of these data, and
that even larger volumes of data are called for.

\caption{A profile of muscle genes enriches for GO ``muscle contraction''
annotation.  Plot of $\bar{r}$ to a muscle profile of 5 genes (UTRN, KCNQ1,
MYOM1, SGCA, ASPH; 13 probesets) annotated with ``muscle contraction''.  Each
probeset is indicated by it's first initial at it's mean correlation to the
profile $\bar{r}$ (x-axis) and the total number of probesets at or below a
given value of $\bar{r}$ (y-axis, left outer scale).  All probesets are also
plotted (solid line, y-axis, left inner scale).  Annotation enrichment p-values
(y-axis, right scale) for all probesets with high values of $\bar{r}$ (x-axis)
is also shown.}
