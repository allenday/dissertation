\acknowledgments {

I would like to acknowledge the guidance and mentorship of S.F. Nelson who has
advised my research projects.

There are also many other people that have helped me with my research over the
last five years and I sincerely appreciate their advice, contributions, and
friendship, and support.  For these reasons, I would particularly like to thank
L. Lee, B. Merriman, M.R.J. Carlson, E. Wong, A. Perry, A. Hodes, C.L. Tso,
J. Braunstein, and J.M. Mendler.

Celsius, the microarray data warehouse project described in Chapter \celsiuschapter, is
the result of collaboration with M.R.J Carlson, J.Dong, and B.D. O'Connor.  M.R.J.
Carlson and B.D. O'Connor provided implementation of the web service through which
Celsius is available to the public.  B.D. O'Connor additionally provided implemention
for the construction of the data warehouse.  J. Dong provided analytical results
which demonstrated that almalgamation of microarray data is methodologically sound.
This project was mentored and originally conceived of by S.F. Nelson.

Biopackages.net, the scientific computing infrastructure project described in Chapter \biopackageschapter,
is the result of collaboration with B.D. O'Connor, J. Mendler and J. Fox.  All collaborators
provided new packages to the software repository.  B.D O'Connor and J. Mendler were
instrumental in implementing, testing, and maintaining the repository and the package
building system.  This project was mentored by S.F. Nelson and L.D. Stein.

GMODWeb, the web developer tool described in Chapter \gmodwebchapter, is the result of collaboration
with B.D. O'Connor.  Both A. Day and B.D. O'Connor provided software implementation.  This project was
mentored by L.D. Stein.

In addition, I would like to thank L.D. Stein, G. Helt, S. Chervitz, S. Cain,
V. Ruotti, L. Sperling, and O. Arnaiz for their advice on the informatics projects
I have contributed to including Celsius, Biopackages, GMODWeb, and the
Distributed Annotation System.  These projects are detailed in Chapters \celsiuschapter,
\biopackageschapter, and \gmodwebchapter, and in Appendix \daschapter.  I would
particularly like to acknowledge B.D. O'Connor for being my sounding board and an
enthusiastic participant and partner in many scientific and software development
endeavors.

I wish to thank M.R.J. Carlson and B.D. O'Connor for their work on making Celsius accessible via web services.

The authors thank J. Braunstein for critical comments on the manuscript.
The work was supported by grants from the NINDS (U24HS052108) and the
NHLBI (HL72367) with support from the NIH Neuroscience Microarray Consortium.

\subsubsection*{Chapter \biopackageschapter\ --- Biopackages.net: Bioinformatics Libraries, Applications, and Data as Operating System Packages}

A. Day and B.D. O'Connor contributed equally to this chapter which is a
manuscript in progress. L.D. Stein is the corresponding author and adviser for
this project.

The authors acknowledge the following individuals for their help in the
development, documentation, testing and maintenance of the software and systems
described here: P. Alger, A. Helsley, and V. Ruotti.  Additionally, we thank
S. Cain, S. Chervitz, and T. Harris for discussion related to the design of the
project architecture.  We thank L. Lee for designing the Biopackages.net website. 

\subsubsection*{Chapter \gmodwebchapter\ --- GMODWeb: A Web Framework for the Generic Model Organisms Database}

A. Day and B.D. O'Connor contributed equally to this chapter which is a
manuscript in progress. L.D. Stein is the corresponding author and adviser for
this project. 

I wish to thank B.D. O'Connor for his significant contributions to the GMODWeb project
which forms the basis for this chapter.  I also wish to thank
S. Cain, O. Arnaiz, and L. Sperling for their extensive testing of the
GMODWeb software.

O. Arnaiz and L. Sperling were supported by the CNRS and by ACI IMPBio2004
contract 14.

\subsection*{Appendix \daschapter --- The Distributed Annotation System}

R.D. Dowell was the first author of this chapter which was originally published in BMC Bioinformatics volume 2, 2001.  The
corresponding author and adviser for this project was L.D. Stein.

This article was reprinted with permission from BioMed Central Ltd. (copyright 2001).

The initial ideas for DAS were developed in conversations with LaDeana Hillier of the Washington University Genome
Sequencing Center.  This work was supported by grants from the NHGRI (2-P01-HG00956) and an HHMI Predoctoral Fellowship
grant to R.D. Dowell.

\subsection*{Appendix \chochapter --- Distinct Transcription Profiles of Primary and Secondary Glioblastoma Subgroups}

C.L. Tso was the first author of this chapter which was originally published in Cancer Research, volume 66, 2006.  The
corresponding author and adviser for this project was S.F. Nelson.

This article was reprinted with permission from the American Association for Cancer Research (copyright 2006).

The work was supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute (U01CA88173), NINDS (U24NS43562),
Women's Reproductive Health Research Center (5K12HD001281), and an Integrated Graduate Education and
Research Traineeship grant to A. Day.
