\acknowledgments {

I would like to acknowledge the guidance and mentorship of S.F. Nelson who has
advised my research projects.

There are also many other people that have helped me with my research over the
last five years and I sincerely appreciate their advice, contributions, and
friendship, and support.  For these reasons, I would particularly like to thank
L. Lee, B. Merriman, M.R.J. Carlson, E. Wong, A. Perry, A. Hodes, C.L. Tso,
J. Braunstein, and J.M. Mendler.

Celsius, the microarray data warehouse project described in Chapter \celsiuschapter, is
the result of collaboration with M.R.J Carlson, J.Dong, and B.D. O'Connor.  M.R.J.
Carlson and B.D. O'Connor provided implementation of the web service through which
Celsius is available to the public.  B.D. O'Connor additionally provided implemention
for the construction of the data warehouse.  J. Dong provided analytical results
which demonstrated that almalgamation of microarray data is methodologically sound.
This project was mentored and originally conceived of by S.F. Nelson.

Biopackages.net, the scientific computing infrastructure project described in Chapter \biopackageschapter,
is the result of collaboration with B.D. O'Connor, J. Mendler and J. Fox.  All collaborators
provided new packages to the software repository.  B.D O'Connor and J. Mendler were
instrumental in implementing, testing, and maintaining the repository and the package
building system.  This project was mentored by S.F. Nelson and L.D. Stein.

GMODWeb, the web developer tool described in Chapter \gmodwebchapter, is the result of collaboration
with B.D. O'Connor.  Both A. Day and B.D. O'Connor provided software implementation.  This project was
mentored by L.D. Stein.

In addition, I would like to thank L.D. Stein, G. Helt, S. Chervitz, S. Cain,
V. Ruotti, L. Sperling, and O. Arnaiz for their advice on the informatics projects
I have contributed to including Celsius, Biopackages, GMODWeb, and the
Distributed Annotation System.  These projects are detailed in Chapters \celsiuschapter,
\biopackageschapter, and \gmodwebchapter, and in Appendix \daschapter.  I would
particularly like to acknowledge B.D. O'Connor for being my sounding board and an
enthusiastic participant and partner in many scientific and software development
endeavors.
