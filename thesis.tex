XXX

I would like to acknowledge the guidance and mentorship of S.F. Nelson who has
advised my research projects.

There are also many other people that have helped me with my research over the
last five years and I sincerely appreciate their advice, contributions, and
friendship, and support.  For these reasons, I would particularly like to thank
L. Lee, B. Merriman, M.R.J. Carlson, E. Wong, A. Perry, A. Hodes, C.L. Tso,
J. Braunstein, and J.M. Mendler.

%The proteomic projects detailed in Chapters \XXXchapter\ and
%\XXXchapter\ were the result of a collaboration with P. Mallick, D. Boutz and
%M. Beeby.  P. Mallick completed an initial computational study linking
%thermophilicity with disulfide bonds.  D. Boutz provided experimental evidence
%supporting my computational results while M. Beeby discovered the distribution
%of PDO across the organisms we analyzed.  S. Sievers helped examine potential
%applications of these finding to fold recognition.

%The genomics project detailed in Chapters \XXXchapter\ and
%\XXXchapter\ were the result of a collaboration with P. Bowers and
%M.R.J. Carlson.  P. Bowers and T.O. Yeates first suggested the idea of using
%logic analysis on microarray data and helped frame the questions we asked
%in these projects.  M.R.J. Carlson also contributed both advice and many hours
%annotating genes, performing data transformations, and other analysis.
%I would particularly like to acknowledge his role as a key mentor in my
%graduate research. He taught me important lessons about clearly communicating
%my research to my peers and for that I am grateful.

In addition, I would like to thank L.D. Stein, G. Helt, S. Chervitz, S. Cain,
V. Ruotti, L. Sperling, and O. Arnaiz for their advice on the informatics projects
I have contributed to including Celsius, Biopackages, GMODWeb/Turnkey, and the
Distributed Annotation System.  These projects are detailed in Chapters \celsiuschapter,
\biopackageschapter, and \gmodwebchapter, and in Appendices \chochapter, \daschapter.  I would
particularly like to acknowledge B.D. O'Connor for being my sounding board and an
enthusiastic participant and partner in many scientific and software development
endeavors.

\subsubsection*{Chapter \celsiuschapter --- Celsius: a community resource for Affymetrix microarray data}

A. Day was the first author of this chapter which was originally published in Genome Biology,
volume 8, issue 6, in 2007.  The corresponding author and adviser for this project was S.F. Nelson.

This article was reprinted with permission from BioMed Central Ltd. (copyright 2007).

I wish to thank M.R.J. Carlson and B.D. O'Connor for their work on making Celsius accessible via web services.

The authors thank J. Braunstein for critical comments on the manuscript.
The work was supported by grants from the NINDS (U24HS052108) and the
NHLBI (HL72367) with support from the NIH Neuroscience Microarray Consortium.

\subsubsection*{Chapter \biopackageschapter\ --- Biopackages.net: Bioinformatics Libraries, Applications, and Data as Operating System Packages}

A. Day and B.D. O'Connor contributed equally to this chapter which is a
manuscript in progress. L.D. Stein is the corresponding author and adviser for
this project.

The authors acknowledge the following individuals for their help in the
development, documentation, testing and maintenance of the software and systems
described here: P. Alger, A. Helsley, and V. Ruotti.  Additionally, we thank
S. Cain, S. Chervitz, and T. Harris for discussion related to the design of the
project architecture.  We thank L. Lee for designing the Biopackages.net website. 

\subsubsection*{Chapter \gmodwebchapter\ --- GMODWeb: A Web Framework for the Generic Model Organisms Database}

A. Day and B.D. O'Connor contributed equally to this chapter which is a
manuscript in progress. L.D. Stein is the corresponding author and adviser for
this project. 

I wish to thank B.D. O'Connor for his significant contributions to the GMODWeb and
Turnkey projects which form the basis for this chapter.  I also wish to thank
S. Cain, O. Arnaiz, and L. Sperling for their extensive testing of the
GMODWed/Turnkey software.

O. Arnaiz and L. Sperling were supported by the CNRS and by ACI IMPBio2004
contract 14.
