\acknowledgments {

XXX

I would like to acknowledge the guidance and mentorship of T.O. Yeates and S.F.
Nelson who have been my co-advisers for my research projects.

There are also many other people that have helped me with my research over the
last five years and I sincerely appreciate their advice, contributions, and
friendship.  For these reasons, I would particularly like to thank E. Wong, A.
Perry, A.  Hodes, D. Finger, N. Chim, C. Theimer, M.R.J. Carlson, A. Day, H.
Adisetiyo, J. Laidman, Y.  Tsai, C. Barnali, M. Sawaya, S. Sievers, D. Boutz,
and M. Beeby for their support.

The proteomic projects detailed in Chapters \XXXchapter\ and
\XXXchapter\ were the result of a collaboration with P. Mallick, D. Boutz and
M. Beeby.  P. Mallick completed an initial computational study linking
thermophilicity with disulfide bonds.  D. Boutz provided experimental evidence
supporting my computational results while M. Beeby discovered the distribution
of PDO across the organisms we analyzed.  S. Sievers helped examine potential
applications of these finding to fold recognition.

The genomics project detailed in Chapters \XXXchapter\ and
\XXXchapter\ were the result of a collaboration with P. Bowers and
M.R.J. Carlson.  P. Bowers and T.O. Yeates first suggested the idea of using
logic analysis on microarray data and helped frame the questions we asked
in these projects.  M.R.J. Carlson also contributed both advice and many hours
annotating genes, performing data transformations, and other analysis.
I would particularly like to acknowledge his role as a key mentor in my
graduate research. He taught me important lessons about clearly communicating
my research to my peers and for that I am grateful.

In addition, I would like to thank L.D. Stein, G. Helt, and L. Sperling for
their advice on the informatics projects I have contributed to including
GMODWeb/Turnkey, Biopackages, Celsius, and DAS/2. These projects are detailed
in Chapters \XXXchapter, \XXXchapter, and the Appendix.   I
would also like to thank S. Cain, and O. Arnaiz for both their feedback and
contributions to testing these open source projects. I would particularly like
to acknowledge A. Day for his constant enthusiasm for open source
bioinformatics and his advice both as a scientist and developer.  Without his
encouragement I would not have been involved in the collaborations that have
shaped so much of my identity as both a biologist and an open source developer.

\subsubsection*{Chapter \celsiuschapter --- Celsius: A Community Resource for Affymetrix Microarray Data}

A. Day was the first author of this chapter which was originally published in Genome Biology,
volume 8, issue 6, in 2007.  The corresponding author and adviser for this project was S.F. Nelson.

This article was reprinted with permission from BioMed Central Ltd. (copyright 2007).

I wish to thank M.R.J. Carlson for his work on making Celsius accessible via web services.

The authors thank Jerome Braunstein for critical comments on the manuscript.
The work was supported by grants from the NINDS (U24HS052108) and the
NHLBI (HL72367) with support from the NIH Neuroscience Microarray Consortium.

\subsubsection*{Chapter \gmodwebchapter\ --- GMODWeb: A Web Framework for the Generic Model Organisms Database}

A. Day and B.D. O'Connor contributed equally to this chapter which is a
manuscript in progress. L.D. Stein is the corresponding author and adviser for
this project. 

I wish to thank B.D. O'Connor for his significant contributions to the GMODWeb and
Turnkey projects which form the basis for this chapter.  I also wish to thank
S. Cain, O. Arnaiz, and L. Sperling for their extensive testing of the
GMODWed/Turnkey software.

O. Arnaiz and L. Sperling were supported by the CNRS and by ACI IMPBio2004
contract 14.

\subsubsection*{Chapter \biopackageschapter\ --- Biopackages.net: Bioinformatics Libraries, Applications, and Data as Operating System Packages}

A. Day and B.D. O'Connor contributed equally to this chapter which is a
manuscript in progress. L.D. Stein is the corresponding author and adviser for
this project.

The authors acknowledge the following individuals for their help in the
development, documentation, testing and maintenance of the software and systems
described here: Patrick Alger, Andrew Helsley, and Victor Ruotti.
Additionally, we thank Scott Cain, Steve Chervitz, and Todd Harris for
discussion related to the design of the project architecture.  We thank Ling
Lee for designing the Biopackages.net website.
